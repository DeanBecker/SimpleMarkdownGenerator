# SimpleMarkdownGenerator
Simple Markdown Generator - Takes C# source and generates docs by way of a simple .md

# Why
Born out of necessity to document ASP.NET WebAPI micro-services, this application helps to generate
simple markdown for C# source that documents methods. At worst, the generated output is a good start
to iterate over manually.

# How
Given an .mdgen file (example contained within ./res/) and a .cs file, the program output will generate
a .md that can be uploaded to an online repo (github, bitbucket et al).
